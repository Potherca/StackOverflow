# What's the name for a mix of snake case and camel case?

At first glance it would appear to be some custom hybrid of `camelCase` and `snake_case` called **`Upper_Snake_Case`** or **`Camel_Snake_Case`**<sup>[1]</sup>.

Closer inspection (as pointed out in the comments below) shows it is an even worse hybrid than that, caused by the inconsistency of not using an underscore `_` before each capitalized letter. 

At this point, the term `lowerCamel_snakeCase` would describe it (although 
 `lower_camelCase_embeddedUnderscore` would be more precise<sup>[2]</sup>) but... **there is no such thing.**

So, if we're making things up anyway, the suggestion of a Mythological Hybrid Animal<sup>â„¢</sup> of awesome ugliness that combines a camel and a snake (and boar and ox or goat) seems fitting.

As **`boarCamel_oxOrGoat_snake_case`** would be a bit too verbose, **`ypotryll_case`** might be a better match<sup>[3]</sup>.

Especially as the [ypotryll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ypotryll) only appears in all of European Heraldry _once_ <sup>[4]</sup>, as the badge of a man dubbed the "Butcher of England" who was known for being ugly and cruel. As he left no heir, the badge was never used again.

This, I feel, makes it a perfect match for this coding standard, both in form (combining a camel and a snake) and function (only encountered once and never to be seen again).

I hope this answers your question, an image of a ypotryll has been added for your viewing pleasure:

## Footnotes 

<sup>[1]</sup> As `Upper_Snake_Case` is often confused with `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` or `MACRO_CASE`, using **`Camel_Snake_Case`** is the safer of the two to use.

<sup>[2]</sup> see http://wiki.c2.com/?CapitalizationRules

<sup>[3]</sup> To place credit where credit is due: the term `ypotryll_case` was coined by [the author of this question](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1664198/mrog) in the comments below.

<sup>[4]</sup> It appears in Fenn's Book of Badges of c.1470 as the badge of John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester.

-   If you get rid of some (not all) of the underscores from upper snake case, then it's not proper upper snake case anymore.

-   Then maybe "Studly\_sNake\_CaPs" is more appropriate? ðŸ¤”
    â€“Â [Potherca][7] [Commented Feb 5, 2019 at 16:04][8]
-   That would work if the upper case letters were in random positions, but I'm only seeing them at the beginnings of words.
    â€“Â [mrog][9] [Commented Feb 5, 2019 at 16:40][10]
-   Then I think we'll have to settle for `lowerCamel_snakeCase`, although `lower_camelCase_embeddedUnderscore` might be more precise... (see [wiki.c2.com/?CapitalizationRules][11]).
    â€“Â [Potherca][12] [Commented Feb 6, 2019 at 8:35][13]
-   Camel\_snake\_case isn't bad. We could shorten it to ypotryll\_case. [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ypotryll][14]
    â€“Â [mrog][15] [Commented Feb 6, 2019 at 18:23][16]
-   I've updated my answer to reflect the insights from these comments.
    â€“Â [Potherca][17] [Commented Feb 7, 2019 at 20:34][18]    
-   You say, "only encountered once and never to be seen again." I'll toast to that, even if my hope is in vain.
    â€“Â [mrog][19] [Commented Feb 7, 2019 at 21:44][20]
-   What about "1337 Case"...
    â€“Â [David Weber][21] [Commented Jul 9, 2022 at 8:27][22]
-   I so much like the word ypotryll(\_case), that I propose to widen the meaning to any case of naming convention you never want to see again. (The proposal to only ever apply it to this one exact case is reasonable and admittedly better matches the history of the word. But, it is so cool....) This of course directly contradicts the comment by @mrog, in spite of the fact that I consider it appropriate and even clicked the "agree" triangle on it.

# Name for addition and multiplication of a sequence of digits, using varying order of mathematical symbols, with the same outcome

I am looking for the correct name for mathematics like this:

$`
1 + 2 \times 3 + 4 \times 5 + 6 \times 7 + 8 = 77
`$

$`
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 \times 8 = 77
`$

$`
1 \times 2 \times 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 \times 8 = 77
`$

That is to say: maths that uses the same digits, in sequence, but with varying mathematical symbols, in order to reach the same integer.

For clarification:

 - The sum doesn't need to be 77, that just an example.
 - Only addition and multiplication are used<sup>1</sup>
 - It could be less digits (e.g. just using 1, 2, 3, and 4)
 - It could be all digits (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)<sup>2</sup>

Anyway, I'd like to learn/read more about things like this, but I have no idea what to look for.

So... **How are these kind of calculations called?**

Until a name for these equations comes to light, I will name them after myself:

# Peachey Equations

To calculate them, I have created [the Peachey Equation Generator][1]

<sup>1</sup> if there is a term, but _only_ if division and subtraction are included, then that's okay too...

<sup>2</sup> Not sure if/where zero fits in here...
